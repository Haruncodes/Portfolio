    <h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ravi!</h1>
    <p>This is my first portfolio website. Exciting times!</p>
    <p> I'm studying <b>Mechanical Engineering</b>, specializing in Renewable Energy in the MAE Department of the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego. I'm also taking a minor in <b>Data Science! </b>As a Mechanical Engineering student, I'm always seeking new opportunities to grow in the clean energy and manufacturing sector. On a more personal note, I enjoy reading books denoting the study of the mind, photographing unique architectural landscapes, and lifting weights. If you believe I could be a good fit to your organization/company or simply like to chat, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's connect!</p>

    <h2><span style="color: #D98324;">Forklift Robot</span></h2>
    <img src="../images/3D robot.png" alt="Project image" width="300">
    <p>This project was part of MAE 3's FA22 offering with Professor Delson, 
      where we were tasked with designing and fabricating a functional robot. 
      Our team created the LiftMaster Bot — a scissor-lift robot capable of 
      lifting payloads using a rack-and-pinion mechanism. Through this project, 
      I gained hands-on experience Swith CAD modeling, 3D printing, and collaborative 
      mechanical design.

    <h2><span style="color: #D98324;">Minihydropower Turbine</span></h2>
    <img src="../images/360energy.png" alt="Project image" width="300">
    <p>
      With 360energy.io, I contributed to the development of a gravitational water 
      vortex power plant designed to provide sustainable energy to rural communities. 
      I supported the CAD and simulation efforts, helped facilitate groundbreaking 
      operations, and participated in the final site inspection to ensure the plant’s 
      readiness. This cross-functional project enhanced my understanding of hydro 
      systems and emphasized the importance of design-to-deployment workflows in 
      renewable infrastructure.

    <h2><span style="color: #D98324;">G-Class Model Rocket (RPL)</span></h2>
    <img src="../images/RPL pic.png" alt="Project image" width="300">
    <p>As part of the Rocket Propulsion Lab’s New Member Project, I worked with 
      a team to design, build, and launch a G-Class model rocket. I was 
      responsible for creating the CAD model, contributing to the assembly 
      process, and ensuring a successful recovery during flight. The experience 
      not only deepened my hands-on engineering skills but also introduced me 
      to high-powered rocketry safety protocols and team-based testing cycles.

    <h2><span style="color: #D98324;">Komatsu Wind Power Project</span></h2>
    <img src="../images/Komatsu.png" alt="Project image" width="300">
    <p> During my internship at Komatsu’s North Jakarta site, I joined the Renewable Energy Program focused on optimizing wind energy systems. My work involved cost analysis and system-level design improvements, particularly researching new battery types for long-term energy storage. This experience exposed me to real-world engineering operations and collaborative problem-solving in a high-impact, industrial environment.
